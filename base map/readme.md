# Amanda Breseman - April 13, 2019 - Whistling Arch
I chose to visit Whistling Arch for my field visit. It was a very accessible trail with some interesting plants along the way. From the small parking lot, the ridgetop trail is .25 miles long and finishes to a large rock shelter with a buttress-type arch. The view to the south from the sandy overlook is quite beautiful.

I seriously contemplated climbing the rock shelter - I decided not to by myself.
